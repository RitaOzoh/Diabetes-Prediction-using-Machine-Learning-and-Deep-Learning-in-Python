# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-in-Python

This Jupyter Notebook project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes in individuals. Using a dataset containing relevant medical features, we employed popular machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for diabetes detection.

Key Features:

-Utilizes a real-world dataset of medical attributes to predict diabetes.

-Implements various machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, CNN, Random Forest, etc.

-Includes data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.

-Evaluates model performance through relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

-Provides insightful data visualizations to gain a better understanding of the dataset.

Technologies:

-Python

-Jupyter Notebook

-Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn

-Scikit-learn and Keras
